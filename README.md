## WatTSR

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for the WatTSR Project. WatTSR is a deep learning architectur based on depp convoultional neural networks for performing traffic sign recognition. Traffic sign recognition is an important task in computer vision, especially for autonomous self driving vehicles. Obtained a final accuracy of **98.6%** using the GTSRB datatset
